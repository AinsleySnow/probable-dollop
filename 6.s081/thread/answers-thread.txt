When thread 1 and thread 2 put values to an entry simultaneously.
Thread 1 has got the desired pointer but hasn't write new value to its next feild.
Then a context switch occurs and thread 2 gets the exactly same pointer and writes an address
to its next field. After that the context is switched back and thread 1 write another address to
the field. Therefore the address written by thread 2 becomes a wild pointer, resulting in a miss.
