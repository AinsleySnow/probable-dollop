1. In general, any system call which has to trap into the kernel for fields will be made faster 
using shared page. In particular, the calls exit, wait, getpid, open, dup, pipe, fstat and stat 
will be made faster. The underlying common point is that these calls all have to trap to get information, 
so just share the information between the kernel and user space will indeed speed these calls up.
