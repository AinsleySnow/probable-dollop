1. Arguments to functions are stored in register a0-a7. 13 is stored in register a2.

2. There is no explict call to f in main, since the complier has optimized the call and just make 
its return value 12 to be the argument of printf(), omitting the call to f.
The call to g has been inlined. The inlined call locates in 0x14.

3. 0x630, obviously.

4. 0x38.

5. Output: He110 World
Set i to 0x726c6400 if the RISC-V were instead big-endian.
No need to change 57616.

6. The value in register a2. For the processer will load the value in a2 since it believes that 
the actually inexisted argument #3 has been stored in it.
